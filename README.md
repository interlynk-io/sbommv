`sbommv` is your primary tool to transfer SBOM's between different systems.It is designed to allow transfer sboms across systems. The tool supports input, translation, enrichment & output adapters which allow it to be extensible in the future. Input adapters are responsbile to interface with services and provide various methods to extract sboms. The output adapters handles all the complexity related to uploading sboms. 

```console
brew tap interlynk-io/interlynk
brew install sbommv
```

## Why sbommv

### The Problem: Managing SBOMs Across Systems

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) plays a crucial role in software supply chain security, compliance, and vulnerability management. However, organizations face a key challenge: **How do you efficiently move SBOMs between different systems?**.

There are two major categories of systems dealing with SBOMs: SBOM Sources (Input Systems) and SBOM Consumers (Output Systems). Manually fetching SBOMs from input systems and uploading them to output systems is: Time-consuming, Error-prone and Difficult to scale.

### The Solution: Automating SBOM Transfers(sbommv)

sbommv is designed to move SBOMs between systems effortlessly. It provides: **Input Adapters**(Fetch SBOMs from different sources) and **Output Adapters**(Upload SBOMs to analysis and security platforms). Currently sbommv support **github** as a input adapter and **interlynk** as aoutput adapter.

## How sbommv Works ?

- Extract SBOMs from Input Systems (GitHub, package registries, etc.)
- Transform or Enrich SBOMs (Future capabilities for format conversion, enrichment)
- Send SBOMs to Output Systems (Security tools, SBOM repositories, compliance platforms)

**Examples**

1. **Generate & Transfer SBOM's for all repositories in Github org of `interlynk-io` to Interlynk SBOM's platform**:
   Generate & Transfer SBOM's from all repositories in the interlynk-io github organization using github apis, and transfer them to interlynk. If interlynk platform does not contain projects it will create them.

   ```bash
   $ export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_klgJBxKukyaoWA******
   $ export INTERLYNK_SECURITY_TOKEN=lynk_api******
   $ sbommv transfer --input-adapter=github --in-github-url="https://github.com/interlynk-io" --output-adapter=interlynk --out-interlynk-url="http://localhost:3000/lynkapi"
   ```

2. **DRY RUN: Transfer SBOM from the latest version of sbomqs to interlynk platform**:
  This will look for the latest release of the repository and check if SBOMs are generated, in dry-run mode, it will just iterate the sboms found, and check if login to the output adapter works.

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_klgJBxKukyaoWA******
   export INTERLYNK_SECURITY_TOKEN=lynk_api******
   sbommv transfer --input-adapter=github  --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs --in-github-method="release" --output-adapter=interlynk  --out-interlynk-url=https://api.interlynk.io/lynkapi --dry-run
   ```

## Adapters 


### Input Adapters

#### GitHub

The **GitHub adapter** allows you to extract/download SBOMs from GitHub. The adapter provides the following methods of extracting SBOMs:

- **Release**:  
  This method looks at the releases for the repository and extracts all the SBOMs that follow the recognized file patterns as described by **CycloneDX** & **SPDX** specs.

- **API** *(Default)*:  
  This method uses the GitHub API to download **SPDX** SBOM for the repository, if available.

- **Tool**:  
  This method clones the repository and runs your tool of choice to generate the SBOM.

---

**Command-line Parameters Supported by the Adapter**

- `--in-github-url`: Takes the repository or owner URL for GitHub.  
- `--in-github-include-repos`: Specifies repositories from which SBOMs should be extracted.  
- `--in-github-exclude-repos`: Specifies repositories to exclude from SBOM extraction.  
- `--in-github-method`: Specifies the method of extraction (`release`, `api`, or `tool`).  

---

**Usage Examples**

1. **For the latest release version of `sbomqs` using the release method**:  
   This will look for the latest release of the repository and check if SBOMs are generated.

   ```bash
   --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs
   --in-github-method="release"
   ```

2. **For a particular release (`v1.0.0`) of `sbomqs` using the release method**:

   ```bash
   --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs@v1.0.0
   --in-github-method="release"
   ```

3. **For only certain repositories (`sbomqs`, `sbomasm`) of `interlynk-io` using the API method**:

   ```bash
   --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io \
   --in-github-include-repos=sbomqs,sbomasm 
   ```

4. **To exclude specific repositories (`sbomqs`) from `interlynk-io` using the API method**:

   ```bash
   --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io \
   --in-github-exclude-repos=sbomqs 
   ```

4. **All repositories from `interlynk-io` using the API method**:

   ```bash
   --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io 
   ```

---


### Output Adapters 

#### Interlynk

The **Interlynk adapter** allows you to upload SBOMs to Interlynk Enterprise Platform. If no repository name is specified, it will auto-create projects & the env on the platform.
To access this platform `INTERLYNK_SECURITY_TOKEN`, will be required. 

---

**Command-line Parameters Supported by the Adapter**

- `--out-interlynk-url` [Optional]: URL for the interlynk service. Defaults to `https://api.interlynk.io/lynkapi`  
- `--out-interlynk-project-name` [Optional]:  Name of the project to upload the SBOM to, this is optional, if not-provided then it auto-creates it. 
- --out-interlynk-project-env` [Optional]: Defaults to the "default" env.   

---

**Usage Examples**

1. **Upload SBOMs to a particular project**:  

   ```bash
   --out-interlynk-project-name=abc
   ```

2. **Upload SBOMs to a particular project and env**:  

   ```bash
   --out-interlynk-project-name=abc
   --out-interlynk-project-env=production
   ```
