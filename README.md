`sbommv` is your primary tool to transfer SBOM's between different systems.It is designed to allow transfer sboms across systems. The tool supports input, translation, enrichment & output adapters which allow it to be extensible in the future. Input adapters are responsbile to interface with services and provide various methods to extract sboms. The output adapters handles all the complexity related to uploading sboms.

```console
brew tap interlynk-io/interlynk
brew install sbommv
```

## Why sbommv

### The Problem: Managing SBOMs Across Systems

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) plays a crucial role in software supply chain security, compliance, and vulnerability management. However, organizations face a key challenge: **How do you efficiently move SBOMs between different systems?**.

There are two major categories of systems dealing with SBOMs: **SBOM Sources** (Input/Source Systems) and **SBOM Consumers** (Output/Target Systems). Manually fetching SBOMs from input systems and uploading them to output systems is: Time-consuming, Error-prone and Difficult to scale.

### The Solution: Automating SBOM Transfers(sbommv)

sbommv is designed to move SBOMs between systems effortlessly. It provides: **Input Adapters**(Fetch SBOMs from different sources) and **Output Adapters**(Upload SBOMs to analysis and security platforms). Currently sbommv support following input and output adapters:

- Input Adapters --> github, folder
- Output Adapters --> interlynk, folder

## How sbommv Works ?

- Extract SBOMs from Input Systems (GitHub, local folders, package registries, etc.)
- Transform or Enrich SBOMs (Future capabilities for format conversion, enrichment)
- Send SBOMs to Output Systems(Interlynk, Dependency-Track(coming soon), folders, Security tools, SBOM repositories, compliance platforms). Whereas the folder output system is just for testing purpose, to see the SBOMs you fetched from Input Adapters.

### Examples

#### 1. Pre-requistic

- Generate **INTERLYNK_SECURITY_TOKEN** with the help of this [resource](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md#2-configuring-interlynk-authentication).
- Until and unless you get an *Rate Limitor error*, github API will work for you. But as you get, generate  GITHUB_TOKEN from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

```bash
   # export the tokens
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_klgJBxKukyaoWA******
   export INTERLYNK_SECURITY_TOKEN=lynk_api******
```

#### 2. Generate & Transfer SBOM's for all repositories in Github org of `interlynk-io` to Interlynk SBOM's platform

Generate & Transfer SBOM's from all repositories in the `interlynk-io` github organization using github apis, and transfer them to interlynk. If interlynk platform does not contain projects it will create them.

```bash
   sbommv transfer --input-adapter=github --in-github-url="https://github.com/interlynk-io" --output-adapter=interlynk --out-interlynk-url="http://localhost:3000/lynkapi"
```

#### 3. DRY RUN: Transfer SBOM from the latest version of sbomqs to interlynk platform:

This will look for the latest release of the repository and check if SBOMs are generated, in dry-run mode, it will just iterate the sboms found, and check if login to the output adapter works.

```bash
   sbommv transfer --input-adapter=github  --in-github-url=https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs --in-github-method="release" --output-adapter=interlynk  --out-interlynk-url=https://api.interlynk.io/lynkapi --dry-run
```

## Adapters

At its core, sbommv acts as a bridge, seamlessly connecting SBOM source systems (e.g., GitHub, AWS, folders, local files) with SBOM consumer systems (e.g., Interlynk, Dependency-Track, folder, security tools) ‚Äî eliminating manual work.
To achieve this, sbommv follows an **adapter-based architecture**, where different systems are abstracted as input and output adapters

Know about more about [adapters](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/adpaters.md), [input adapters](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/input_adpaters.md) and [output adapters](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/output_adapters.md).
