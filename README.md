`sbommv` is the primary tool for transferring SBOMs between systems ‚Äî‚Äî built to fetch SBOMs from input sources, translate formats, enrich metadata, and push them to output destinations. At its core is a `modular`, `adapter-based` architecture that makes it flexible, scalable, and ready for the future to easily plug in and plug out new tools or systems or platforms.

## SBOM Platform - [Interlynk](https://app.interlynk.io/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Using Prebuilt binaries

```console
https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/releases
```

#### Using Homebrew

```console
brew tap interlynk-io/interlynk
brew install sbommv
```

#### Using Go install

```console

```

#### Developer Installation

This approach involves cloning the repo and building it.

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:interlynk-io/sbommv.git`
2. `cd` into `sbommv` folder
3. make; make build
4. To test if the build was successful run the following command `./build/sbommv version`

## Quick Start

- Fetch/Pull SBOM from Github and save it to a local folder

```bash
$ sbommv transfer --input-adapter=github \
--in-github-url="https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs" \
--in-github-method="release"  --output-adapter=folder \
--out-folder-path="demo"
```

- Fetch/Pull SBOM from Github and push it to a Dependency-Track

```bash
$ sbommv transfer  --input-adapter=github  \
--in-github-url="https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv"  \
--output-adapter=dtrack  \
--out-dtrack-url="http://localhost:8081"
```

**NOTE**: Make sure dependency-track is running locally, if not, [refer](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/examples/setup_dependency_track.md) for setup.

- [Get started](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md) with sbommv.

## sbommv features

- It allows to fetch SBOMs from github API, Github Release Pages, and folder, refer [here](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/input_adpaters.md) for more..
- It allows to send SBOMs to Dependency-Track, Interlynk, Folde, refer [here](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/output_adapters.md) for more.
- It allows continous folder monitoring and transferring SBOMs continously by running into daemon mode, [refer](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/examples/folder_real_time_monitoring_to_dtrack.md) here for more.
- Internally it uses Protobom library forinter-format conver, read more about it [here](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbommv/blob/main/docs/conversion_layer.md).
